tcp: connection-oriented, reliable, byte stream service

connection-oriented:  two applications using TCP must establish a TCP connection with each other before they can exchange data.
                      Broadcasting and multicasting aren't applicable to TCP.
                      
reliable: 
    sender:
        data broken
        a segment with timer
    receiver:
        send an acknowledge when receiving data(delay a fraction of a second)
        correct order
        discard duplicate data
        flow control(a finite amount of buffer space)
    both sender and receiver:
        checksum(when a segment arrives with invalid checksum, TCP discards it and doesn't acknowledge receiving it. it excepts the sender to time out and retransmit)
            
byte stream service:
    one end doesn't know what size another one writes, and it doesn't care the content
    
tcp header:
    normal size is 20 bytes, unless options are present.
    16-bit source port number                                                       16-bit destination port number
                                                32-bit sequence number
                                                32-bit acknowledge number
    4-bit header 6-bit reserved  6-bit urg/ack/psh/rst/syn/fin                      16-bit window size            
    16-bit tcp checksum                                                             16-bit urgent pointer
  
    source port and destination port identify the sending and receiving application.
