the routing table can be updated by:  1. a routing daemon
                                      2. ICMP redirect message
                                      3. route command
                                      4. netstat command

the steps that IP performs when it searches its routing table:
1. search for a matching host address
2. search for a matching network address
3. search for a default entry(the default entry is normally specified in the routing table as a network entry, with a network ID of 0.)

routing policy: is a set of rules that decides which routes go into the routing table.
routing mechanism: decides which interface to send a packet out when searching the routing table
netstat -rn   r: list the routing table   n: prints IP addresses in numeric format

G: the route is to a gateway(route). If this flag is not set, the destination is directly connected.
H: the route is to a host, that is, the destination is a complete host address.
   If this flag is not set, the route is to a network, 
   and the destination is a network address:
   a net ID, or a combination of a net ID and a sunbet ID.
D: the route was cerated by a redirect
M: the route was modified by a redirect
