->  SYN=1 seq=x             SYN_SENT
<-  SYN=1 ACK=x+1 seq=y     SYN_RECV
->  ACK=y+1                 ESTABLISHED
Q1:
    can initial sequence number X and Y be fixed?
    NO, router will cache data packet unpredictable, if it did and client drops, when client connect to server again, client will receive packet that ACK number is larger than now.
Q2:
    if client sents a SYN to server then disconnect, what will happened?
    when server SYN+ACK packet times out, server will send again, the time offset will be twice than last time. 
    Linux will re-sent 5 times which last 63-second. attacker will send vast SYN to server(called SYN flood) to exhaust SYN queue.
